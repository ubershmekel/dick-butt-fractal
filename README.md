# Dick Butt Fractal

In 2014 when dick-butt was trending, I decided to make a fractal animation of it. I used request-animation-frame and some awkwards JavaScript tweening for the animation. When I discovered it worked in Chrome but completely failed in Firefox, I gave up.

In 2020 I decided to fix it. I would have preferred a slow crawling and smooth animation. But I wasn't able to get the animation timing function to smoothly loop - so that's why the dick-butt is bouncing.
